## My process

You've got to start with the HTML - after adding the components there, into CSS we go to make it look pretty and give it an animation!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS animations
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Styling isn't usually one of my strong suits - I was challenged with all of the new things I've learned with CSS over the last few months to truly style something similar to what I've seen, and I don't think I did a bad job, if I do say so myself.  

### Continued development

More front-end projects incoming!  I'm going to be working on a few more projects in the coming weeks, and I'm excited to see what I can do with them.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Animations](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_animations.asp) - got my animation instructions here!
- [CSS Flexbox](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox.asp) - I was torn between choosing block or flexbox, but I'm glad I went with flexbox in the end.
